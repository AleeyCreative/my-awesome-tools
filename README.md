# my-awesome-tools
A WIP repository to contain links and description of some of my tools which includes softwares, libraries, and plugins.

1. [Trilium Notes]: Hierarchical Note taking application. Quite effective for building knowledge bases. 
2. [Google Docs]: I usually use this to draft more formal documents that I would like to access and edit across devices.
